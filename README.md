# Develop this project just for fun

- This project performs web scraping on the website https://www.megasena.com/resultados to capture Megasena's historical data.
- Furthermore, several data treatments needed to be carried out as the data coming from the website was not consistent.
- At the end, a map is generated with the visualization of cities in the states of SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais with an indication of which cities have already had Mega-Sena winners who matched the 6 draw numbers.
- You must have Python > 3.0 installed to run the etl.py file.
- Additionally, install the libraries using the command in the terminal (you need to have pip installed) in the project root directory:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**
